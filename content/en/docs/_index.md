# Welcome MCH2022 participant!

In all likelihood you came here because you want to learn how to get the most out of your MCH2022 Badge...

Please proceed to the [**MCH2022 section**](badges/mch2022/), where we have gathered all necessary information for you.

If you are having difficulties getting The Badge badge up and running, first
reread the [**Getting Started**](badges/mch2022/getting-started) instructions
then check our [**Troubleshooting**](badges/mch2022/support/troubleshooting_faq) Hints. You can do both of these things
at the [Badge Tent](https://map.mch2022.org/#map=20/5.5274/52.2839/0) where you
will find friendly Badgers to assist you!

## In case you're here for another badge ...  

Uups, apologies. Don't forget that this site caters to quite a number of events
that have badges built on the same technology, in case you received such a
badge and are looking for pointers on how to use it, please proceed to [choose
your badge](badges).

All resource on this site are works-in-progress. Please let us know if you find
any errors or run into corner that could be explained more clearly by opening
an [issue](https://github.com/badgeteam/website/issues) or [pull
request](https://github.com/badgeteam/website/pulls) in the documentation
[website repo](https://github.com/badgeteam/website/). For example, this page
should revert to being a generic badge documentation site after
[MCH2022](https://wiki.mch2022.org/Main_Page).  Thanks!
