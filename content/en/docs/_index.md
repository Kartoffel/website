# Welcome!

On this website you will find the documentation and API reference of the BADGE.TEAM project.

We're currently in the process of finalizing our APIs and the platform firmware itself. Meanwhile we ask you to keep an eye out for mistakes.

If you find a bug, documentation mistake or want to contribute please create a github issue describing what you want.
