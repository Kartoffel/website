Your MCH badge comes with installed software which allows you to select and run applications, install new applications from our online hatchery, and set up badge functions such as the Wi-Fi password.

This page is a high-level introduction to the installed software. If you came here looking for details on how to write software for the badge, then [take a look at our software development guide](../../software-development/).
